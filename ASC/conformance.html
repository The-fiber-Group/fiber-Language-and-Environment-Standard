			In this Standard, the words "must", "shall", and "will" will be interpreted as a strict requirement of an implementation or program.
			"must not", "shall not", and "will not" will be interpreted as a strict prohibition.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			If a requirement is not met, the behavior of an implementation or program shall be undefined.
			The terms "undefined" and "not specified" are used in contexts where the any behavior or property will be acceptable.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			A <b>strictly conforming implementation</b> shall realize only the properties and requirements set out in this document.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			A <b>conforming implementation</b> shall fully realize the properties and requirements set out in this Standard and is allowed to exhibit properties or behavior not defined in this document.
			A conforming implementation with any properties that are not within the scope of this Standard shall not allow these other properties to affect any requirements or behavior described in this Standard.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			A <b>partial implementation</b> fully implements most of the standard.

		<li><p>
			Implementations of this standard shall include a conformance statement.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The conformance statement should be accessible to users of the implementation with reasonable ease.
			The means through which the statement is included and presented to the user are unspecified.
		</p></li>

		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Implementations of the Fiber Language and Environment Standard shall include a conformance statement.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The conformance statement should be accessible to users of the implementation with reasonable ease.
			The means through which the statement is included and presented to the user in an implementation are not part of this standard.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			A <b>strictly conforming implementation</b> shall include the statement:<br> 
			"<i>This is a complete implementation of ASC 0.0.</i>"
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			A <b>conforming implementation</b> shall include the statement:<br> 
			"<i>This is an extended implementation of ASC 0.0.</i>"
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			A <b>partial implementation</b> shall include the statement:<br> 
			"<i>This is an incomplete implementation of ASC 0.0.</i>"
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Conforming and partial implementations of this standard are further required to specify exactly what deviations the implementation makes from a strictly conforming implementation.
