		<li><p>
			This standard specifies the form and interpretation of computer programs written in the ASC language.

		<li>
			<p>
				This Standard specifies...
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the representation and interpretation of ASC programs</li>
				<li>the syntax of the ASC programming language</li>
				<li>the representation of data manipulated by ASC programs</li>
				<li>the restrictions and limits set to a "conforming implementation" of this standard</li>
				<li>the abstract computer architecture with which ASC programs may be executed with</li>
				<li>the instruction set that is interpreted by the abstract computer architecture</li>
				<li>the format for storing programs to be executed by the abstract computer architecture</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				This standard does not specify...
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the methods by which an ASC program is transformed for interpretation by the abstract computer architecture</li>
				<li>the methods by which an ASC program is executed by the absract computer architecture</li>
				<li>the methods that may by used to invoke an ASC program</li>
				<li>the resolution of the capabilities of the abstract computer architecture with the capabilities of the underlying computer hardware used by an implementation</li>
				<li>the hardware-specific capacity limits that may affect an ASC program or the abstract computer architecture</li>
				<li>the methods by which output data is transformed after it leaves an ASC program</li>
				<li>the minimum requirements which a computer needs to support a conforming implementation</li>
