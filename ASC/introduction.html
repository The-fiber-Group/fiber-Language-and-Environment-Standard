	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			This document describes a programming language and an abstract architecture which programs written in that language may be executed with.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			All properties of the standard described in this document are premanent and cannot be arbitrarily removed.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Other properties may be added later only if they do not affect currently existing properties.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			If two properties are found to conflict, the most recently added, or least significant, property should be removed.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Existing properties may be changed if the general design of computing technology has developed to a point where its functionality is so foreign to the architectures targeted by this standard that the language is no longer compatable or viable on that architecture.
			The commonality of the incompatable architecture must be taken into account for this clause to apply.
			If the architecture in question is not generally used in most computing applications, this standard is not required to be adapted to suit that architecture.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Notation Conventions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			Examples are provided to show a selection of possible forms a construct can take in actual use.
			Examples will be given in a <code>monospaced font.</code>
		</p></li>
		<li><p id="Reference">
			References are used in this document to refer to material in other sections.
			References are given by the section title and clause number in italics in parentheses <a href="#Reference">(<i>Notation Conventions, 2</i>)</a>.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Terms defined within this document will be cited using a numbered, hypertext link<sup><a href="#terms">0</a></sup>.
			All appearances of terms are not required to be cited, but the first appearance of a term should be cited.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Recommendations are provided to suggest helpful approaches for implementors.
			Recommendations are not requirements.
			<rec>Recommendations are written with a slightly smaller, and lighter colored font.</rec>
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Without sacrificing clarity, preference should always be given to plain language, rather than technical language, when describing ideas in this Standard.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Grammar Notation</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			Syntax is described using terminal and non-terminal entities in a modified Backus-Naur form.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The names of non-terminal entities are written in <b>bold font</b>, followed by an arrow(&rarr;).
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Each non-terminal is followed by a series of other terminal or non-terminal entities separated by vertical bars.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The names of terminal entities are written in <i>italicized font</i> followed by an arrow (&rArr;).
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Each terminal entity is followed by a single POSIX Extended Regular Syntax expression.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			An entity that is neither bold nor italicized refers to the top non-terminal entity from an external syntax diagram.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			A terminal entity may optionally be written in-place using a <code>monospaced font</code>.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			An entity that is optional shall be <u>underlined</u>.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
