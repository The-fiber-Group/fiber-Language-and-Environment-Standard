	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			This document describes a programming language and an abstract architecture which programs written in that language may be executed with.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			All properties of the standard described in this document are premanent and cannot be arbitrarily removed.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Other properties may be added later only if they do not affect currently existing properties.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			If two properties are found to conflict, the most recently added, or least significant, property should be removed.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Existing properties may be changed if the general design of computing technology has developed to a point where its functionality is so foreign to the architectures targeted by this standard that the language is no longer compatable or viable on that architecture.
			The commonality of the incompatable architecture must be taken into account for this clause to apply.
			If the architecture in question is not generally used in most computing applications, this standard is not required to be adapted to suit that architecture.
