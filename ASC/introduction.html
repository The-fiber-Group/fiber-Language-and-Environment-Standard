	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			This document describes a programming language and an abstract architecture which programs written in that language may be executed with.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			All properties of the standard described in this document are premanent and cannot be arbitrarily removed.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Other properties may be added later only if they do not affect currently existing properties.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			If two properties are found to conflict, the most recently added, or least significant, property should be removed.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Existing properties may be changed if the general design of computing technology has developed to a point where its functionality is so foreign to the architectures targeted by this standard that the language is no longer compatable or viable on that architecture.
			The commonality of the incompatable architecture must be taken into account for this clause to apply.
			If the architecture in question is not generally used in most computing applications, this standard is not required to be adapted to suit that architecture.

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Computation has traditionally be reasoned about as a side effect of the pursuit of some scientific or mathematical result.
				As a consequence, computation is always expressed in terms of some mathematical or scientific system.
				However, computation is inaccurately represented by this approach.
				Mathematics and the sciences are chiefly concerned with the association of a result with some source data.
				Computation is inversely concerne with the formulaic means of arriving at a result given some input.
				There are multiple aspects which pertain only to the pursuit of a result which are negligible in other traditional representations.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first is <i>precision</i>. 
				A computation is inherently bound by precision. 
				Precision directly affects the amount of work performed for any given computation.
				It also affects the amount of information required for a computation to be performed successfully.
				Precision directly affects the accuracy of the result of a computation.
				More precision allows for greater accuracy.
				Precision also affects how long a computation will continue before arriving at a result.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second is <i>temporality</i>.
				A computation is never static.
				It will always change over time.
				In other fields of study, these changes are discarded or made implicit, in favor of representing the final state.
				In computation, these changes are much more significant because they provide information to reason abou the precision of a computation.
				The ordering of each change within a computation has a dynamic effect on the progress of a computation through time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third is <i>representation</i>.
				The amount of information which a computation must accept directly affects both its precision and temporal properties.
				More information requires more time, but provides greater precision.
				Representation also allows the nature of temporal changes to be reasoned about.
				How a representation, and the information it contains, changes from one point in time to another greatly affects the properties of a computation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The final aspect is <i>efficiency</i>.
				The combination of the amount of information required by a computation, the amount of time required by a computation to complete, and the precision of the result is described by the effiiency.
				A computation which is highly efficient requires less information and less time to provide results with greater precision.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given these aspects which are unique concerns of computing, a new descriptive system should be developed which provides first-order faculties to reason about the precision, temporality, representation, and efficiency of a computation.
				ASC fulfills these requirements by providing a rich means to represent information and the changes applied to it as well as means to divide a computation according to formulaic ordering and abstract domains of concern.
