	<ol>
		<li><p>
			This document describes a programming language and an abstract architecture which programs written in that language may be executed with.

		<li><p>
			All properties of the standard described in this document are premanent and cannot be arbitrarily removed.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Other properties may be added later only if they do not affect currently existing properties.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			If two properties are found to conflict, the most recently added, or least significant, property should be removed.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Existing properties may be changed if the general design of computing technology has developed to a point where its functionality is so foreign to the architectures targeted by this standard that the language is no longer compatable or viable on that architecture.
			The commonality of the incompatable architecture must be taken into account for this clause to apply.
			If the architecture in question is not generally used in most computing applications, this standard is not required to be adapted to suit that architecture.

			<p><rec>The following is not a part of the standard documentation of ASC, but rather a summary of the reasons for its inception...</rec></p>
			<p>
				Computing is a relatively new field of study compared to mathematics and science.
				Algebra and the classical sciences have existed for more than a thousand years.
				What sets computing apart as a new field, rather than an another area of study, is that classical fields are concerned with the result of a calculation, whereas computing is concerned with the means.
				The broad field of computing can then be generalized as the study of how something might be calculated.
			</p>
			<p>
				The means of calculation spans many mathematical and scientific fields depending on what part of calculation is studied.
				Scientific theory applies to how computation may be realized physically.
				Mathematical theory applies to how computation may be carried out.
				This is demonstrated by the famous Turing machine and Lambda Calculus.
				Both systems are able to generally describe any algorithm performed over some numbers, however their realization of the algorithm is radically different.
				The Turing machine is a metaphysical design for a device which will interpret symbols to read and write other symbols using a physical medium.
				Lambda Calculus is a mathematial logic for composing and applying functions.
				These two systems demonstrate clearly the tendency for computation to be represented as an extension of some other scientific or mathematical system.
				This makes it difficult for computation itself to be reasoned about as it is always expressed using the terms of another field.
			</p>
			<p>
				If computation is its own field, and other systems are not suitable for expressing it, a novel system is required to express computation in terms of what it is.
				But what then are the concepts that are unique to computation?
				The first is <i>state</i>.
				When carrying out an algorithm, any amount of temporary information and intermediate products may be used in the calculation of the final result.
				State is also more generally the concern for how any information may be represented and handled for carrying out an algorithm.
				The second is <i>temporality</i>.
				All computation happens over time.
				Some parts of an algorithm may happen at different points in time, others may occur at the same time.
				The third is <i>granularity</i>.
				Parts of a computation may be separated into smaller components which are themselves individual computations.
				These smaller computations may be observed in larger, separate systems of computation.
