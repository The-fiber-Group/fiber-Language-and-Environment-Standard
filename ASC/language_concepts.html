			An ASC program consists of a number of <b>entities</b> which contain data.
			<rec>An entity here is not described as an object because entities in ASC programs are not required to hide any internal information they may contain.</rec>
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Each entity has a <b>representation</b>, a <b>type</b>, and a <b>name</b>.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Representations determine the precision, physical size, and mutability of the data contained by an entity.
			<b>Constant</b> (non-mutable) entities are used to define the behavior of a program.
			Mutable entities are used to hold data as operations are performed on it by the program.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Types determine the set of possible data values that can be held by an entity and the operations that are available for that set.
			Types are used to verify that the behavior of the program is correct, or rejected as incorrect according to requirements established by type definitions.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Names determine the contexts within which an entity is accessible.
			Names are used during a program's execution to locate both the constant entities containing transformations that the program will perform, 
			and the mutable entities which hold the data being transformed.
		</p></li>
