	<ol>
		<li><p>
			An ASC program consists of a number of <b>entities</b> which contain data.
			<rec>An entity here is not described as an object because entities in ASC programs are not required to hide any internal information they may contain.</rec>
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Each entity has a <b>representation</b>, a <b>type</b>, and a <b>name</b>.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Representations determine the precision, physical size, and mutability of the data contained by an entity.
			<b>Constant</b> (non-mutable) entities are used to define the behavior of a program.
			Mutable entities are used to hold data as operations are performed on it by the program.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Types determine the set of possible data values that can be held by an entity and the operations that are available for that set.
			Types are used to verify that the behavior of the program is correct, or rejected as incorrect according to requirements established by type definitions.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Names determine the contexts within which an entity is accessible.
			Names are used during a program's execution to locate both the constant entities containing transformations that the program will perform, 
			and the mutable entities which hold the data being transformed.
		</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>A number of primitive entities are provided by the ASC language for creating programs. They are...</p>

	<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			ASC syntax is composed of individual tokens which consist of contiguous series of characters.
		</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Tokens are delimited by any blank or non-printable characters including...
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ASCII Control Characters (in a range from Null to Unit Separator)</li>
				<li>Space</li>
				<li>Unicode point 0081</li>
				<li>Unicode point 008D</li>
				<li>Unicode point 008F</li>
				<li>Unicode point 0090</li>
				<li>Unicode point 009D</li>
				<li>Unicode point 00A0</li>
				<li>Unicode point 00AD</li>
				<li>Unicode range from 2000 to 200F)</li>
				<li>Unicode point 2028</li>
				<li>Unicode point 2029</li>
				<li>Unicode range from 205F to 206F</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><p>
			Tokens are divided into two classes, <b>symbols</b> and <b>ternimals</b>.
			Symbols are used to name entities.
			Ternimals are used to compose and delimit expressions.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="symbols">Symbols</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			Symbols consist of a contiguous series of alphanumeric characters and the ASCII dash character.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Alphanumeric characters are defined as the ASCII code point ranges 30-39, 41-5A, 61-7A, and any Unicode points that fall under the Unicode standard definition of <i>Writing Systems</i>.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The ASCII dash character is allowed in a symbol at any point where it is not the first or last character in that symbol.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Symbols are case insensitive.
			The ASCII code points 41-5A and 61-7A are considered lexically equivalent for the purposes of the ASC language.
			The equivalence is not general across all points, rather each individual point from the first range is equivalent to the point from the corresponding position in the second range.
			For example, the symbols <code>symb</code>, <code>SYMB</code>, and <code>sYmB</code> are considered the same symbol.
		</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>
				In the Unicode Latin-1 Supplement block, the code point pairs are considered lexically equivalent in the following ranges... 
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr><td>00C0-00D6</td><td>00E0-00F6</td></tr>
				<tr><td style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:inherit;border-bottom-width:1px;" colspan="2"></td></tr>
				<tr><td>00D8-00DD</td><td>00F8-00FD</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				For example, the characters <code>&#x00C6;</code> and <code>&#x00E6;</code>, and the characters <code>&#x00DD;</code> and <code>&#x00FD;</code> are each considered lexically equivalent.
				
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>
			In the Unicode Latin Extended-A block, in the code point range U+0100-U+017E, each even-numbered code point is considered lexically equivalent with the immediately following odd-numbered code point.
			For example, the characters <code>&#x0102;</code> and <code>&#x0103;</code> are equivalent.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="operators">Terminals</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			Terminals consist of a contiguous series of non-alphanumeric characters including the ASCII dash character.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Non-alphanumeric characters are defined as the ASCII code points 21-2F, 3A-40, 5B-60, 7B-7E, and any Unicode points which fall under the Unicode standard definition of <i>General Punctuation</i>.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Unlike symbols, the ASCII dash character is accepted at any point within a terminal.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
