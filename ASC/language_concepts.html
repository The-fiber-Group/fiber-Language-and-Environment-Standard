	<ol>
		<li><p>
			An ASC program consists of a number of <b>entities</b> which contain data.
			<rec>An entity here is not described as an object because entities in ASC programs are not required to hide any internal information they may contain.</rec>
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Each entity has a <b>representation</b>, a <b>type</b>, and a <b>name</b>.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Representations determine the precision, physical size, and mutability of the data contained by an entity.
			<b>Constant</b> (non-mutable) entities are used to define the behavior of a program.
			Mutable entities are used to hold data as operations are performed on it by the program.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Types determine the set of possible data values that can be held by an entity and the operations that are available for that set.
			Types are used to verify that the behavior of the program is correct, or rejected as incorrect according to requirements established by type definitions.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Names determine the contexts within which an entity is accessible.
			Names are used during a program's execution to locate both the constant entities containing transformations that the program will perform, 
			and the mutable entities which hold the data being transformed.
		</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>A number of primitive entities are provided by the ASC language for creating programs. They are...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>symbols</li>
				<li>types</li>
				<li>variables</li>
				<li>operators</li>
				<li>continuations</li>
				<li>functions</li>
				<li>modules</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><p>
			Entities are instantiated in a program via <b>declaration</b> and <b>definition</b>.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			An entity declaration establishes its name and type.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			An entity definition establishes its representation and the initial data that it will contain when 
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			An entity declaration is required before the definition of that entity occurrs.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The complete definition of an entity may be established by multiple separate expressions.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="program_execution">Program Execution</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			Program execution is facilitated by the evaluation of expressions in an environment of data objects.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The evaluation of expressions may produce some value or effect on the data held by mutable entities.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			There are three discrete stages in program execution which occurr in the order of, <b>inspection</b>, <b>translation</b>, then <b>interpretation</b>.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Each stage must be completed before the next can occurr.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			No stage is required to be completed in a single event.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The execution process may be applied individually to parts of a program, or uniformly to an entire program. 
			The granularity of execution is implementation dependent.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Program execution begins when an implementation is provided a program to execute through one or more <b>streams</b> containing source text.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="streams">Streams</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			A stream is an abstract data buffer containing traversable ASCII or Unicode encoded text.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Streams are only required to be traversable in a forward direction so that the source text may be read in the order it was written.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Streams may support random stream position seeking.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The contents of a stream are not required to be persistent beyond a single reading.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			A stream may be derived from the contents of a <b>source file</b> containing ASCII or Unicode encoded source text.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
