		<li><p>
			The "Fiber Group" is the designated central body of authors that shall and maintain this Standard and its documentation.
			Any individual who's work is incorporated into this Standard shall be included in the Fiber Group.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			All rights concerning this Standard, its documentation, and the concepts described therein are reserved by the Fiber Group as a collective whole.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The Fiber Group is responsible for the development of this Standard and any concepts it describes.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The Fiber Group shall include a "central" authorship role for a single author that grants them the exclusive right to overrule any and all decisions made by the Fiber Group.
			The central author shall not have the ability to proactively make independent decisions for the Fiber Group.
			This position shall be passed to another author at the central author's discretion.
			If the previous central author is not available to appoint a new central author, the new central author shall be chosen from the Fiber Group by a majority vote of the Fiber Group members.
		</p></li>
		<li id="authoring changes">
			<p>
				Changes or additions to this Standard may be proposed from outside the Fiber Group.
				These changes should be communicated in a well documented proposal.
			</p>
			<p>
				A proposal must...
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>clearly describe what changes it is proposing</li>
				<li>note what portions of this Standard the proposal would affect if it were accepted</li>
				<li>provide a rationale for the changes or additions</li>
				<li>give a detailed description of all properties of the changes or additions</li>
				<li>note the ramifications of each change or addition to this Standard</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><p>
			This Standard will be formatted and distributed as an HTML document.
			HTML is compact, efficient to maintain, an can be navigated quickly.
			Web browsers and other HTML document renderers are ubiquitous across all user-oriented devices.
			Almost all operating systems are distributed with a default web browser.
			Additionally, the HTML language does not rely on the support and maintenance of any one single party and therefore the format has wider adaptability and a longer support lifetime.
			This ensures that the documentation for this Standard will be optimally accessible for a very long period of time.
