			This Standard will be formatted and distributed as an HTML document.
			HTML is compact, efficient to maintain, an can be navigated quickly.
			Web browsers and other HTML document renderers are ubiquitous across all user-oriented devices.
			Almost all operating systems are distributed with a default web browser.
			Additionally, the HTML language does not rely on the support and maintenance of any one single party and therefore the format has wider adaptability and a longer support lifetime.
			This ensures that the documentation for this Standard will be optimally accessible for a very long period of time.
