	<ol>
		<li><p>
			The instruction set for the IISC architecture is a RISC instruction set.
			<rec>The purpose of the IISC instruction set is to provide a portable medium to store programs that will be eventually translated into some hardware instruction set for execution. 
				As such, the IISC instruction set includes some abstractions in order to account for possible discrepancies between architectures.</rec>
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			IISC instructions are encoded using values from the ASCII table.

	<h2 id="memory_model">Memory Model</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			IISC does not enforce a specific memory model.
			The position and memory addressing strategy is dependent on the target architecture.
			Memory addresses are described using terms relative to the beginning of the segment of memory in question.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Any non-address values stored in a IISC program that are used as memory addresses are not guaranteed to be compatable with the target architecture or produce predictable results.
