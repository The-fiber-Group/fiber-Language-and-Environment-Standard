	<h1>Architecture</h1>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			The IISC architecture consists of an unlimited number of 128 bit temporary registers, four 64 bit special purpose registers, and a linear address space consisting of 2<sup>64</sup> (or 1.84467440737e+19) individually addressable bytes.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The IISC architecture is intended to be translated to instructions for an existing hardware instruction set before execution.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="registers">Registers</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				The special purpose registers are...
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Stack
					<p>The stack register can be used to hold the top of a program stack structure.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Base
					<p>The base register can be used to hold the base of the program stack segment or the base address of the writeable section of memory provided to the program.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Zero
					<p>The zero register holds a static value of zero at all times. It cannot be written to.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Instruction
					<p>The instruction register holds the address of the current instruction.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><p>
			All temporary registers are capable of holding all single-register data types available in the IISC instruction set.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			All special purpose registers are capable of holding all data types that are 64 bits or less in size.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Data written directly to a special purpose register is not guaranteed to be preserved for future reading after it has been written as further instruction execution may automatically change the value in some registers.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2 id="register_data_types">Register Data Types</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			IISC has a number of single-register data types called <b>word data types</b>.
			Each of these data types is represented by 64 bits or less of precision.
		</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>
				The IISC word-oriented data types are...

		</li>
		<li><p>
			The binary format of word-oriented data types is implementation dependent.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Unsigned word data types (Unsigned Word, Unsigned Half-word, Unsigned Quarter-word, Unsigned Byte) represent whole positive numbers starting with zero and continuing until a certain precision of maximum value.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			Signed word data types (Signed Word, Signed Half-word, Signed Quarter-word, Signed Byte) represent whole positive or negative numbers with the range of values being determined by the precision of the type.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			The Large and Small Floating Point data types correspond to the Single (32b) and Double (64b) precision binary floating point representations specified in the <a href="_A_S_C_.html#references">IEEE 754 standard</a> for floating point representations.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			As all data types are binary, the contents of registers may be treated as any type.
			<rec>It is not recommended to ignore binary representation formats as this will have negative effects on the reliability of a program.</rec>
		</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="memory_model">Memory Model</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
			IISC does not enforce a specific memory model.
			Various memory addressing modes may be used by the underlying hardware.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			An implementation may support a smaller address space than 2^64 addresses.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			IISC explicitly has no endianness.
			Endianness is only introduced when IISC is translated to a hardware architecture that requires endianness.
			<rec>Individual bytes of a single-register value stored in memory may still be read and oriented into a register according to a certain endianness pattern, but the resulting value held in the register is not guaranteed to be the same as the value stored in memory.</rec>
