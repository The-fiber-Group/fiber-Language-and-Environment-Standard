			The ASC programming language is designed for a specific abstract computer architecture.
			This architecture is refered to as IISC (<u>I</u>ntermediary <u>I</u>nstruction <u>S</u>et <u>C</u>omputer).
		</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>IISC includes...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>an abstract CPU architecture</li>
				<li>an instruction set for the emulated CPU</li>
				<li>a limited memory model scheme for facilitating structured program execution</li>
				<li>a binary object format used for storing and distributing programs</li>
				<li>a linking and loading system for executing programs stored as binary objects</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><p>
			IISC does not abstract interactions with the operating system.
			The abstract CPU architecture does not include many architecture specific behaviors that are common in real hardware.
			Functionality for, among other things, privilege levels, memory security, and ports are not considered.
			<rec>It is discouraged to extend an implementation of IISC with support for these functionalities.</rec>
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			IISC allows for ASC program components to be stored in either a system-native or IISC-native encoding.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
			IISC allows for ASC program components of any system-native or IISC-native format to be combined and executed as one cohesive program.
			<rec>IISC is designed to function transparently as part of the underlying operating system. 
				It should be implemented to behave similarly to the native operating system when executing programs.
