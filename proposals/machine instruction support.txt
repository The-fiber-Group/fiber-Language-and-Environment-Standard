Proposal for Machine Instruction Support

Purpose:
To allow program components to be constructed in the assembly language of the
host system and incorporated into a fiber source file.

Description:
The fiber programming language will support an assembly syntax that can be used
to write parts of a fiber program directly as machine instructions. Fiber should
support writing instructions in both BRISC format and some other native format 
related to the target system.

Additional Details:
Should this support be implemented in the base language or in the standard 
libraries?
