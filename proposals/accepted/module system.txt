Proposal to Add a Module System to the fiber Language

Purpose:
  A Module system will allow for source code to be organized into reuseable 
packages and will allow for separate compilation schemes.

Description:
  The module system will allow the programmer to declare a module containing a 
number of object declarations and definitions. Each module will have two 
distinct sections, public and private. Objects declared in the public section 
will be visible both inside the local module and outside the local module. 
Objects declared in the private section will only be visible to other objects 
within the local module.

  Modules may include other modules and normal source files. If another module
is included, its public objects may be used in the including module. If a 
normal source file that does not contain a module is included, that source code
is interpreted as being part of the module.

  Objects can be declared in any order in a module.

  Objects are declared public by default in a module. A delimiting operator 
denotes where the private section of the module begins lexically.

  Modules can include a section containing program verification code that will
be compared against the objects in that module. This section is bounded by a
pair of operators. Program assertions can only apply to objects within the 
local module.

Syntax:
  Module opening delimiter:		&%

  Module closing delimiter:		%&

  file include prefix:		$"

  module include prefix:		&$

  private delimiter:			&~

  assertion opening delimiter:	%$

  assertion closing delimiter:	$%
