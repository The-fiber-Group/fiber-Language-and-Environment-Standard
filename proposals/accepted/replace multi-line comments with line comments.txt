Proposal to Replace Multi-line Comments with Single Line Comments

Purpose:
  Replacing the syntax for multi-line comments with single-line comments reduces
the amount of typing required for adding small comments. Most of the use of 
comments in programs are small, single line comments rather than multi-line 
comments. Using single-line comments instead of multi-line allows the programmer
to write comments with less characters.

Description:
  The double-backquote operator that surrounds multi-line comments will be 
repurposed to prefix a single-line comment. The new syntax will define a 
comment as the text between a double-backquote operator and a line break (some
combination of line feed and carriage return characters.)
