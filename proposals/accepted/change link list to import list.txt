Proposal to change the name of the BOF Link List section to Import List

Purpose:
  To improve the clarity about the role of the Link List section of a BOF object
the name "Link List" should be changed to "Import List". The name "Import List"
more aptly describes what the list is used for and avoids ambiguity with the 
data structure name "linked list" which is an unrelated concept to the Link List
in the BOF format.
