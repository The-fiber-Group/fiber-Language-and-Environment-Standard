A Proposal to Implement an Ordered Type Interface to the Program Stack

Author: fiber Group

Purpose:
  The fiber programming language already allows ad-hoc overloading of functions,
operators, and arbitrary syntax patterns. Interface data types would explicitly
require the overloading of a set of functions for each instantiation of that
data type. This allows for normal dependent data types to be extended with 
associated functions and syntax.
