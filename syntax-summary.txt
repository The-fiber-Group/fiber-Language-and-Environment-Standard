fiber syntax (only the things that aren't already written into the standard)


function syntax:

functions are declared with curly braces.
the first symbol after the opening curly brace is the function name.
functions can use generic, or type-specific parameters.
functions can be overloaded with different arity.
functions can be declared and defined separately.

function parameters are listed using the identifier syntax.
parameters after the '=' are return parameters.
the colon is used after the parameter list to signify the beginning of a 
function body.
